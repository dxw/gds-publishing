## What we did
We defined two routes for account creation depending on whether a user needed access to Whitehall. This allowed us to include additional options for Whitehall users on types of access. 

Additionally both types of account had the option to request access to applications beyond the basic applications that all users are granted access to. For this approach we used the radio option component with a conditionally revealed question that would allow users to explain what they needed in a free textbox.
