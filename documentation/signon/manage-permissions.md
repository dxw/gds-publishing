## What we did

## Why we did it

## Previous design

## First design iteration
The first design iteration prioritised as much as possible a like-for-like transition of the existing design replicated in the GOV.UK Design System. There wasn't a comparable component in the design system for filters to be laid out horizontally that worked well for this kind of page. We therefore took inspiration from the design applied to [GOV.UK Search](https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=article&order=relevance) to filter results.
