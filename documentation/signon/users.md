# Users page
- Author(s) Calum Ryan

## What we did
- Updated design of the Users list and individual edit pages from existing Bootstrap to GOV.UK Design System
- Phased accessibility improvements to overall design that meet WCAG 2.2 (AA)
- Incorporated search and filtering of users based on component used in GOV.UK website search

## Why we did it
To help make managing and editing other users permissions easier and more accessible. The existing design had been in use for many years, but without a consistent interface that was very accessible.

## Previous design
![Bootstrap designed page with filters at the top laid out horizontally and table of users below](https://github.com/dxw/gds-publishing/assets/2226904/18aff832-4411-43bf-b546-1b4c914a9259)


## First design iteration
The first design iteration prioritised as much as possible a like-for-like transition of the existing design replicated in the GOV.UK Design System. There wasn't a comparable component in the design system for filters to be laid out horizontally that worked well for this kind of page. We therefore took inspiration from the design applied to [GOV.UK Search](https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=article&order=relevance) to filter results.

### New users page

### GOV.UK Search to filter results
